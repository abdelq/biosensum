      <description>Each year, a new BiosensUM team representing the University of Montreal (and Canada!) at the SensUs Competition is formed. It consists of a team of students from the various schools of the University of Montreal Campus, Polytechnique, HEC and Université de Montréal. We need chemists and biochemists for the development of the test and its chemical and biological optimization. Physicists, engineers and computer scientists are also needed for the development and programming of the analytical instrument.</description>

      <description>BiosensUM is a multidisciplinary student team that represents Canada in the 2018 SensUs Contest. This Canadian crew is coming from the Université de Montréal and its associated schools, Polytechnique Montréal and HEC Montréal. Graduate and undergraduate students are from different academic fields such as Biochemistry, Chemistry, Engineering, Computer Science and Marketing.
SensUs is the first international student competition on the development of molecular biosensors for healthcare applications. SensUs is organised by the students of Eidenhoven University of Technology, in the Netherlands, in collaboration with professors of international universities.</description>
