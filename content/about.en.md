BiosensUM is a multidisciplinary student team that represents Canada in the
[2018 SensUs Contest](https://sensus.org).
This Canadian crew is coming from the
[Université de Montréal](http://umontreal.ca) and its associated schools,
[Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca) and
[HEC Montréal](https://hec.ca).
Graduate and undergraduate students are from different academic fields such as
Biochemistry, Chemistry, Engineering, Computer Science and Marketing.

SensUs is the first international student competition on the development of
molecular biosensors for healthcare applications. SensUs is organised by the
students of [Eidenhoven University of Technology](https://tue.nl), in the
Netherlands, in collaboration with professors of international universities.

The team members decided to compete in SensUs because they wanted a new
challenge, and it is a big one! To successfully complete this interdisciplinary
project, they will need to work together as a team to develop a new
point-of-care biosensor for vancomycin, an antibiotic. BiosensUM members will
learn new sensing techniques, combine programming technologies and elaborate a
business plan for their future enterprise.

BiosensUM is ready for this challenge and hopes to achieve it successfully!
