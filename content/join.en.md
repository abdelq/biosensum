Each year, a new BiosensUM team representing the University of Montreal
(and Canada!) at the [SensUs](//sensus.org) Competition is formed. It consists
of a team of students from the various schools of the University of Montreal
Campus, Polytechnique, HEC and Université de Montréal. We need chemists and
biochemists for the development of the test and its chemical and biological
optimization. Physicists, engineers and computer scientists are also needed for
the development and programming of the analytical instrument. Students in
industrial design are also welcome to optimize the user-friendly, innovative and
portable aspect of the instrument.

The competition also has an entrepreneurial aspect requiring people from the
field of marketing, business development and so on. Finally, we need someone to
be responsible for external relations, sponsors and social networks.

The competition requires a commitment of about a year. The team will be formed
around November 2018 and the SensUs 2019 competition will be held in September
2019 in Eindhoven, Netherlands. If you are interested or have any questions,
write us at [biosensum@gmail.com](mailto:biosensum@gmail.com).

## Conditions

- Be a Bachelor or Master at the University of Montreal, HEC or Polytechnic.
- Spend between 5 and 10 hours a week on the project.
